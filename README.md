# Graph Neural Network for Ionic Liquids and-Deep Eutectics Solvent Property Prediction - A Cheminformatics Study
A Deep Learning Framework for Predicting Physicochemical Properties of Ionic Liquids and Deep Eutectic Solvents using Message Passing Graph Neural Networks (NNConv)

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a **Graph Neural Network (GNN)** model based on the **Neural Network Convolution (NNConv)** architecture for the **prediction of key physicochemical properties of Ionic Liquids (ILs)**.  

It represents an intersection of **computational chemistry**, **cheminformatics**, and **deep learning**, leveraging molecular graph representations and message passing to capture intricate structural and electronic interactions within IL systems.

## Motivation

Ionic liquids (ILs) and Deep Eutectic Solvents (DESs) are versatile materials with broad applications in **green chemistry**, **energy storage**, **lubrication**, and **separation processes**. However, their vast chemical space makes experimental property measurement infeasible for all combinations.
This project aims to address that challenge by developing a **data-driven predictive framework** that learns directly from molecular structures to estimate physicochemical properties.

## Key Features

- **NNConv-based GNN Architecture:**  
  Implements a flexible **message passing neural network** that dynamically learns edge-conditioned transformations between atom pairs.

- **Transfer Learning Extension:**  
  The trained IL model was fine-tuned for training and evaluating the **Deep Eutectic Solvents (DESs)**.

- **Comprehensive Cheminformatics Integration:**  
  Utilizes tools such as **RDKit** and **OpenBabel** for:
  - Molecular graph construction  
  - Node features and global features generation  
  - SMILES parsing and molecular standardization  

- **Data Pipeline and Preprocessing:**  
  - Accesses and preprocesses IL property data directly from the **NIST ILThermo database**.  
  - Includes data cleaning, feature normalization, and dataset splitting utilities.  
  - Handles both **cation-anion pair representation** and global system descriptors.

- **End-to-End Reproducibility:**  
  Provides all scripts and utilities to:
  - Train the IL model
  - Transfer Learning of the IL model to DESs  
  - Evaluate model performance  
  - Visualize learning curves and prediction accuracy

- **Parameter Settings:**
  - All the settings used in this work for model architecture, data preprocessing, etc. are provided in the params.yaml file in code folder

## Model Architecture

The core architecture uses the **NNConv** layer from PyTorch Geometric to learn edge-conditioned message functions, enabling adaptive feature propagation across molecular graphs.

**Highlights:**
- Node embeddings represent atom-level features (atomic number, degree, valence, etc.)  
- Edge embeddings represent bond information (type, conjugation, ring status, etc.)  
- Global features incorporate molecular-level descriptors (e.g., polarity, molar mass, number of hydrogen donors and acceptors)  
- Final readout combines local and global embeddings through fully connected layers
